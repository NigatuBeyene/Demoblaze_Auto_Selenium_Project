test was given a different section on the web page i do the following pages:longin page, aboutUs, register,

My tests were divided according to the pages I had to test 
and also according to the division into Web and Server. in the Web
i have Base_test, Locatores, Pages, Tests, Utils
# Tools:
In this project I used Pytest, Selenium, Appium, Requests, Allure
The Bonus was to execute The tests from Jenkins.
I add Sanity and Regression builds, when there is change in the project this builds run automatically.
